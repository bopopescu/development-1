   # The AccessCache value is populated at the time the document
   # is indexed.  
   # Unfortunately, the type of information cached for the NT
   # Filesystem is quite different from the type of information
   # cached for the Unix Filesystem.  So we define a field for
   # each, although only one will get populated.  Although you
   # may leave both fields in the DDD, you can increase performance 
   # and reduce space consumption by commenting out the cache
   # field for the platform NOT used for indexing.  Note that
   # using the "$ifdef TP_<MKENV>" syntax to conditionally define
   # the AccessCache field by according to platform would incur the
   # penalty of losing collection cross-platform portability.
