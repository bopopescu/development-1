  # filters. There can be more than one "autorec" keyword in this file.

  # are specified, with the first one being attached to the gateway
  # and the last one being attached on the other end to the universal
  # filter.

  # The very first token that this list of filters produces MUST be
  # the VdkTokenType_ContentType token. If it isn't, the universal
  # filter will not work properly.

  # To enable filtering of zip files uncomment the entry further
  # below for the mime type application/zip.
