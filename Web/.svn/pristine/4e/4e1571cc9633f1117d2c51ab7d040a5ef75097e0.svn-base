  <hr size=1 noshade>
  The <b>Translate</b> section gives you the ability to translate the major sections of the auction Website from English to any other language (text on additional pages may require page level translation).  Visual Auction Multinational provides an easy-to-use interface so that your translator can quickly and easily translate each page on the Website.  The translated text goes directly into the database so users can switch languages "on-the-fly".<br><br>
