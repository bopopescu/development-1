      This page shows all the categories currently available on the auction site.
      The top portion of the page allows you to add a new category, or edit an existing one if
      one was selected from the list below and the "Edit" button was clicked.<br><br>
      <b>Category Name</b> - The name of the category being added/edited.<br><br>
      <b>Active</b> - If this box is checked, the category is active and auctions can be held in it.<br><br>
      <b>Sales</b> - If this box is checked, then public sales can occur in the category.  Leave this box unchecked for
      auctions where only the person running the site is allowed to sell items.<br><br>
      </table>
     <b>Create New Category Layout</b>- Clicking on this will take you to a new screen where you will choose the category you want to edit and then click edit.<br>
      From here you can edit the color of each category and also add a banner to the category page.<br>
      There are some sample banners supplied for your use.<b><font color="red">Pictures of the pages that open when editing categories are below.</b></font color="red"><br><br>
      <b>Exclusive Listing</b>- This area will allow you to assign a category to one user. No one else will be able to list in this category.<br>
      Enter the name you want on that category and put the users ID Number in the ID number box. Then click <b>Add New</b>

      <font size=3 color="008000"><b>Auction Category Page - Bottom Section:</b></font><br><br>
      The bottom section, called the <i>Category Browser</i>, allows you to browse through all
      your current categories and subcategories.  The light blue box starting with "[Top]"
      shows the current path within the subcategories.  The list shows all of the categories
      on the current level. The buttons to the right are as follows:
      <br><br>
      <b>Top</b> - Returns you to the top level, which shows all of the main categories.<br><br>
      <b>Edit</b> - Allows you to edit the currently selected category; the page will reload with the category's information
      in the top section of the page.  Click the "Update" button to save your changes to the
      category when you are done.<br><br>
      <b>Delete</b> - Deletes the current category.  Note: In order to delete a category, it
      must not contain any subcategories.  You must first delete all the subcategories before
      you can delete the parent category itself.<br><br>
      <b>Expand</b> - Expands the currently selected category 1 level.  If the selected category has
      any subcategories, they are shown at this time, otherwise "[empty]" is shown instead.<br><br>
      <b>Collapse</b> - Collapses the currently selected category 1 level.  This then shows all categories
      1 level above the category you were in.<br><br>
      <b>NOTE: Categories which contain 1 or more subcategories are shown in the list with a plus (+) sign next
      to their name and a number in parenthesis (), indicating how many subcategories it
      contains.  The number is not the total number of subcategories, but how many that are 1 level beneath it.</b><br><br>
      To create subcategories within other existing categories, simply expand the category you want
      to create a subcategory in and add the category there.  Don't worry if the list shows
      "[empty]", for this just means there are currently no subcategories in the category you have selected;
      you will still be able to add subcategories.
